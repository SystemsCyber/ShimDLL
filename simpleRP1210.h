 * Program Name: simpleRP1210.h (header file for the C program)
 * 
 * Description: A proof of concept written to be compiled with MSVC on Windows
 * to interface with basic functionality of American Trucking Association,
 * Technology Maintenance Council (TMC) Recommended Practice number 1210.
 * This Windows API for truck diagnostics tools gives us the ability to write programs
 * that can use the device. 
 * The API can be purchases through the ATA. At one point in time (2023) the  RPs could
 * be purchased through the web: https://tmc.trucking.org/TMC-Recommended-Practices
